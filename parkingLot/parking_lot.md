# Problem: parking lot
## Nature of the problem

We want to understand how you think as a programmer, and the level of craft you bring to bear when building
software.

Of course, the ideal would be a real world problem, with real scale, but that isnʼt practical as it would take too
much time. So instead we have a dead simple, high school level problem that we want you to solve as though it
was a real-world problem.

### Rules of the problem
1. We are really interested in your object oriented or functional design skills, so please craft the most
beautiful code you can.
2. Weʼre also interested in understanding how you make assumptions when building software. If a particular
workflow or boundary condition is not defined in the problem statement below, what you do is your
choice.
3. You have to solve the problem in Java, Scala or C++ without using any external libraries to the core
language except for a testing library for TDD. Your solution must build+run on Linux. If you don't have
access to a Linux dev machine, you can easily set one up using Docker.
4. Please use Git for version control. We expect you to send us a standard zip or tarball of your source code
when you're done that includes Git metadata (the .git folder) in the tarball so we can look at your commit
logs and understand how your solution evolved. Frequent commits are a huge plus.
5. Please do not check in binaries, class files, jars, libraries or output from the build process.
6. Please write comprehensive unit tests/specs. For object oriented solutions, it's a huge plus if you test
drive your code.
7. Your codebase should have the same level of structure and organization as any mature open source
project including coding conventions, directory structure and build approach (make, gradle etc) and a
README.md with clear instructions.
8. Please ensure that you follow the syntax and formatting of both the input and output samples.
9. Please do not make either your solution or this problem statement publicly available by, for example,
using github or bitbucket or by posting this problem to a blog or forum.

### Problem Statement

I own a parking lot that can hold up to 'n' cars at any given point in time. Each slot is given a number starting at 1
increasing with increasing distance from the entry point in steps of one. I want to create an automated ticketing
system that allows my customers to use my parking lot without human intervention.

When a car enters my parking lot, I want to have a ticket issued to the driver. The ticket issuing process
includes us documenting the registration number (number plate) and the colour of the car and allocating anavailable parking slot to the car before actually handing over a ticket to the driver (we assume that our
customers are nice enough to always park in the slots allocated to them). The customer should be allocated a
parking slot which is nearest to the entry. At the exit the customer returns the ticket which then marks the slot
they were using as being available.

Due to government regulation, the system should provide me with the ability to find out:
+ Registration numbers of all cars of a particular colour.
+ Slot number in which a car with a given registration number is parked.
+ Slot numbers of all slots where a car of a particular colour is parked.

We interact with the system via a simple set of commands which produce a specific output. Please take a look
at the example below, which includes all the commands you need to support - they're self explanatory.
1. It should provide us with an interactive service prompt based shell where commands can be typed in
2. It should accept a filename as a parameter at the service prompt and read the commands from that
file

**Example: File** To install all dependencies, compile and run tests:
```bash
$ bin/setup
```
To run the code so it accepts input from a file:
```bash
$ bin/parking_lot file_inputs.txt
```

**Input (contents of file):**

```bash
create_parking_lot 6

```

**Output (to STDOUT):**

**Example: Interactive** To install all dependencies, compile and run tests:
```bash
$ bin/setup
```
To run the program and launch the shell:
```bash
$ bin/parking_lot
```
Assuming a parking lot with 6 slots, the following commands should be run in sequence by typing them in at a
prompt and should produce output as described below the service. Note that exit terminates the process
and returns control to the shell.
```bash
$ create_parking_lot 6
